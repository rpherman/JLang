# JLang
My J learning exercises and all things J-related.

## sars-cov-2-DSEIR.ijs

This J code is based upon Tyler Limkemann's Blog posting on Modeling the COVID-19 Outbreak with J:

https://datakinds.github.io/2020/03/15/modeling-the-coronavirus-outbreak-with-j

and gui code from tangentstorm's J-talks repository:

It is a mashup of the two references and my own glue in order to better understand the J language. I am not an epidemiologist either, and I cannot vouch for the validity of the model.
